        "Neural networks consist of **nodes**, which take in several input weights and a bias, and produce an output. A neural network consists of several connected layers of these nodes, which ultimately produce an output in the final layer, which is the output of the entire network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nodes may sometimes have **activation functions**, which are functions applied to nodes that will produce a certain output. For example, the **sigmoid** activation function will produce an output from 0 to 1. The sigmoid activation function is particularly useful for **multi-class multi-label classification** and **binary classification**. Another common activation function is **softmax**. Softmax will take a layer of neurons and produce a probabiltiy distribution of that layer. Softmax is often used for **multi-class single label classification**.\n",

        "A CNN takes this concept a step further. A CNN takes in an image tensor as input (length **x** width **x** channel amount). After the input layer, several **convolutions** will occur onto the image from several **filters**, or kernels, throughout the entire image. The results of these convolutions is passed onto a **pooling layer**, where sets of pixels are condensed into a single pixel, thus shrinking the length and width of the result of the convolutional layer. This result is then passed onto pontentially more convolutional and pooling layers, repeating the process until satisfactory.\n",

        "Note: The convolutional and pooling layers are efficient for images because the filters perform their own feature extraction on the images, and can recognize patterns and features from anywhere on an image (this kind of feature-location independence is lost when using passing in images to a basic neural network).\n",
        "\n",
        "After the final pooling layer, the ouput tensor of that layer is flattened into a vector, and this vector is passed into a set of dense layers. At the end of these layers, an output will be produced (the output depends on the task, i.e. **image classification**)."
